Projects covered in the first lesson are in the file '01'

	You can look at the other files if you want, but you're not expected to
	know what some of the functions are yet. If you want to test different
	types of encryption methods (just the output), then go to the file 
	'encryption_project' and run: 
		'python3 test.py <encryption method>'
